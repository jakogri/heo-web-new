# Contributing

Everyone is very welcome to contribute HEO Codebase. We are constantly growing our community and would
love to hear your ideas. Feel free to add issues on our Github (https://github.com/HEO-Platform/heo-web/issues)
or pick some easy ones to implement.

## Workflow
We use GitFlow workflow for contributions. When you pick an issue to work on, create a local feature branch
with issue number in the branch name. E.g., if you are up for adding chain switching to the web app (https://github.com/HEO-Platform/heo-web/issues/79),
create a feature branch called `multichain-79`. Commit your code to your feature branch, make sure it works with
the testnet contracts. When you are ready to create a Pull Request, squash your commits, add a descriptive
commit message, and create a Pull Request. One of the project committers will review your PR promptly.

## Coding style

We try to conform to [standard](https://standardjs.com/) coding style, and we expect contributors to do their
best to conform to the same coding style as well. Please add comments to your code, so we know what it is meant
to do.
